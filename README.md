The Brisbane 2032 Gold Pass is a new web application looking to revolutionise the ticketing experience in the leadup to the 2032 Brisbane Olympic Games. For more general information on the project, visit the frontend repository [here](https://github.com/Wo-m/tickexperience-frontend)

This repository contains the backend for frontend, which handles API requests and interacts directly with the database system. This implementation uses Java (Spring Framework) and a local H2 database.
